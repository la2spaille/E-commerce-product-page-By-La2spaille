## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Javascript


### What I learned

I learned a bit more about arrays in Javascript and "forEach" function.

### Continued development

Now I plan to learn more about native JavaScript for future annimation and the BEM method.


### Useful resources

- [Ressource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to make the "input" element have the same heigth as the "Add to cart" button with "align-items: stretch;" css statement.
